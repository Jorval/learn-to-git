# learn-to-git
A repo just to learn git

Hi,
This Repo is only for me to learn git and how to use the Atom Editor in conjuction with github.
Also i like to try out Kraken which i have since Beta Relase but never ever really used it because i never got warm with git or other versionsystems.

Yesterday i decided it's about time!

So if you stumbled over this project leave an issue or another form of contribution to help managing the task a git repo offers.

thanks. jorval
