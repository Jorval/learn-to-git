# learn-to-git
A repo just to learn git

Hi,
This Repo is only for me to learn git and how to use the Atom Editor in conjuction with github.
Also i like to try out Kraken which i have since Beta Relase but never ever really used it because i never got warm with git or other versionsystems.

Yesterday i decided it's about time!

So if you stumbled over this project leave an issue or another form of contribution to help managing the task a git repo offers.

thanks. jorval

# Pimping Atom for Github use
i found a package that let me use git commands directly from Atom without switching to my terminator session. Awesome. Installing it led's to a LOT more of these packages for Atom. Diversity is not a crime right!<br />
so i stick with the first package i found which is called **Git-Plus**<br />
if that sucks ... i'll try the next package and so on.

# Pimping Atom Part 2
ok... as commiting and status doesn't worked by me as expected with Git-Plus i now installed **git-control**. Whe i open up the corresponding Feature in atom it say this is not a git project.<br />
maybe this was also the problem with Git-Plus. don't know, still investigating this.
